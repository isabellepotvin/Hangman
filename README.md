# Hangman

This program allows users to play a simple game of hangman. The users have the option to play
the game, read instructions on how to play or view highscores. The program loads in 10,000 common medium 
length words and chooses one randomly for each round of the game. The program also loads in previous 
highscores and saves (on exit) any new ones that have been set.
